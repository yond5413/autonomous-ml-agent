# Autonomous Tabular ML Agent

This project is an implementation of the Autonomous Tabular ML Agent as described in the PRD.

## Phase 1: Streamlit UI + Orchestrator Agent

The first phase of this project is to create a Streamlit front-end that allows a user to upload a CSV file, select a target column, and then kick off an orchestration loop. The orchestrator agent will then use a sandboxed preprocessing agent to explore the data and return a summary.
